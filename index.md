# Walter Vue's homepage

My name is Walter Vue.  I'm a returning student who has decided to explore the IT field with specialization in Data Analytics.  I'm a 36 year old father of 3 with 11 years of work experience in Quality Assurance.  One of my core values is appreciating family and friends.  A few of my interests are sports such as Football and Volleyball, gaming, and being a car enthusiast.  

I've decided to make a career change after 11 years of work related to my degree in biology to Data Analytics because I want to do more and experience more in life.  I've always had an interest in the IT field but that wasn't the route I chose during my time at UW-Lacrosse.  Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks!  I think that I would make a good data analyst because the level of coding isn't as extreme as it would be for a software developer, and I currently work with data and reporting.  The analysis portion of that data is what I'm interested in learning to comprehend.

A few of my personal goals in life are to create a stable environment for my kids to grow up in and to help them be the most sucessful version of themselve.  I, personally, want to learn new things and make the most of my experiences whether that comes in meeting new people or visiting new places.

My educational goal is, simply, to graduate from the Data Analytics program and learn a new profession.  Although continuing with more education would be preferential, focusing on creating a good work/home/school life is my main purpose.

My professional goal is to find a career that is related to Data Analytics, preferably with the company i currently work with.  If that role is not one that is supported, I'd be willing to start a new career.
